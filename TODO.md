- Decide SLAs
Here is some of the revised SLAs:
1. Response Time: 
- Issues: Response within 48 hours - check if the issue has been responded by anyone from the turbot org.
2. Issue Backlog: Check if it has been already replied/responded to and if it has already been, check if I got back to the author of the issue within 2weeks.
